This folder includes the pseudo-acceleration for each [CIRES (Centro de Instrumentacion y REgistros Sismico, a. c.)](http://www.cires.org.mx/) station for the North-South and East-West directions.


The raw seismic recordings for the 2017 Puebla earthquake can be accessed at [CIRES Busqueda de registros](http://www.cires.org.mx/registro_es.php).
The seismic recordings were processed in Matlab and [SeismoSignal](https://seismosoft.com/product/seismosignal/).


Python code for the processing of seismic recordings can be found at [gmpe-smtk/smtk/response_spectrum.py](https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk/blob/master/smtk/response_spectrum.py)
