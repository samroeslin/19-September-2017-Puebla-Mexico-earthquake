This folder includes the pseudo-acceleration for each CIRES station for the North-South and East-West directions.
The raw CIRES data was processed in Matlab and [SeismoSignal](https://seismosoft.com/product/seismosignal/).
Python code for the processing of seismic recordings can be found at [gmpe-smtk/smtk/response_spectrum.py](https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk/blob/master/smtk/response_spectrum.py)
